# Text-Classifier
Text classification with multiple methods

This is my answer to HW3 of Modern Information Retrieval course, Fall 2022. More information about the course is available in this [link](https://sharif.edu/~beigy/14011-40324.html).

In this mini project, I implemented a text classifier with 3 methods: kNN, SVM(using sklearn library) and Naive Bayes.
